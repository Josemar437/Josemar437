## 🧠 About this Lab

This repository is not a personal profile.  
It is a **computational laboratory** dedicated to the development of:

- High-fidelity CFD simulations
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
- Numerical methods for PDEs
- Embedded systems for scientific instrumentation
- Aerodynamic modeling and stability analysis
- Scientific software architecture for engineering problems

All projects here follow a single principle:

> **Mathematics first. Code second. Tools last.**

## 📐 Engineering Philosophy

Every project in this lab obeys:

- Verification against classical references (White, Patankar, Özışık)
- Direct mapping between equations and implementation
- Deterministic, reproducible computational experiments
- Separation between physics, numerics, and software layers

If a line of code cannot be traced back to an equation, it does not belong here.

## 🔬 Active Investigations

- PINNs for steady heat conduction (∇²T = 0)
- Mesh quality impact on CFD convergence
- Hard vs Soft constraints in physics-informed learning
- Surface treatment and wall roughness modeling in CFD
- Embedded data acquisition for experimental validation
